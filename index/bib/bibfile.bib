One thing that is still not clear however is what exactly constitutes a waste? How much do we know about what should be classed as waste? What are the historical contexts of waste managements? The present paper seeks to examine these vital questions with a view to providing answers from previous studies. The paper employed a desktop approach to provide answers to the research objectives. Specifically, the paper uses a descriptive approach to gather information from peer reviewed publications such as, journal articles, environmental organizations reports and books. It was found that, waste is to a large extent subjective in meaning as a substance can only be regarded as a waste when the owner labels it as such. This is particularly true because one individual may regard a substance as a waste, while another may view the same substance as a resource. Nevertheless, it was argued that there is a need to clearly define what constitute wastes as this form the basis for regulation.},

The Convention initially opted for ‘restriction’ over ‘prohibition’ by establishing a regulatory scheme. This scheme allows any transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes to proceed only when such movements adhere to the rules of the Convention under the Prior Informed Consent ({PIC}) mechanism and the observance of the environmentally sound management. It also provides a limited ban, prohibiting any transboundary movement between Party and non-Party to the Convention. However, Article 11 provides an exception for such prohibition if there is an agreement or arrangement between a Party and non-Party to the Convention which stipulates provisions that are “not less environmentally sound” than the standard of the Basel Convention.},

This legal regime is supplemented with the Bamako Convention prohibiting import of hazardous wastes in African countries. They have large number of memberships and are successful in achieving the underlined objectives with the application of {PIC} mechanism. But for certain obvious reasons, smuggling of hazardous wastes and their transboundary movement in disguise of recycling them or using them as raw materials are on the rife, especially to African, Central Asian and South Asian countries. There are a number of cases proving this. Among them, the Trafigura case of Ivory Coast is the most notable one. The paper sheds light on topical issues pertaining to the legal regime. It also looks into the probable reasons for which poor countries succumb to be used as dumping grounds. The authors suggest that the provisions of the conventions should be strictly followed and for that all countries, developing, least developed and developed, should have enough political will to properly enforce the law based on the {PIC} principles. They also suggest that the membership of the Basal Convention should further be increased so that the menace of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, which infringes the sovereignty of poor sates, and violates rights of their citizens, could me alleviated.},

This article investigates the relationship between the conclusion of environment-related international treaties and the adoption of domestic environmental legislation. Thanks to data sets that are considerably more comprehensive and fine-grained than those previously used, we can analyze the direct link to environmental legislation rather than the less direct link to environmental outcomes. Moreover, we can disaggregate for specific environmental issue areas. Our results suggest a positive relationship between domestic environmental legislation with both international environmental agreements and preferential trade agreements ({PTAs}) with environmental provisions. This link is more robust for {PTAs}, mostly present in developing countries, more pronounced before rather than after the treaties' entry into force, and shows significant variation depending on the issue area. These findings contribute to the literature on environmental regime effectiveness and the domestic impact of treaties.},

Scholars in the fields of international relations and comparative politics have identified a wide array of convergence mechanisms operating at the international or transnational level. In order to categorize this wide array of possible causes of policy convergence, we propose a typology of three broad classes of mechanisms: (1) the co-operative harmonization of domestic practices by means of international legal agreements or supranational law; (2) the coercive imposition of political practices by means of economic, political or even military threat, intervention or conditionality; and (3) the interdependent but uncoordinated diffusion of practices by means of cross-national imitation, emulation or learning. We illustrate and substantiate this claim through the empirical analysis of the international spread of three different kinds of policy innovation: national environmental policy plans and sustainable development strategies, environmental ministries and agencies, and feed-in tariffs and quotas for the promotion of renewable electricity.},

In the absence of formal obligations, regulatory instruments that have been communicated internationally and were already being practiced elsewhere were voluntarily emulated and adopted by policy makers. While the international promotion of regulatory instruments often facilitated their diffusion, the instruments’ characteristics determined the extent and speed by which regulatory instruments spread across countries. The voluntary adoption of regulatory instruments cannot be exclusively explained by the rational motivation of policy makers to improve effectiveness. In addition, they were motivated by concerns of legitimacy and perceived pressure to conform with international norms.},

Constructivists trace policy norms to expert epistemic communities and international organizations, who deﬁne economic progress and human rights. Coercion theorists point to powerful nation-states, and international ﬁnancial institutions, that threaten sanctions or promise aid in return for ﬁscal conservatism, free trade, etc. Competition theorists argue that countries compete to attract investment and to sell exports by lowering the cost of doing business, reducing constraints on investment, or reducing tariff barriers in the hope of reciprocity. Learning theorists suggest that countries learn from their own experiences and, as well, from the policy experiments of their peers. We review the large body of research from sociologists and political scientists, as well as the growing body of work from economists and psychologists, pointing to the diverse mechanisms that are theorized and to promising avenues for distinguishing among causal mechanisms.},

While the descriptive findings above are largely correct, the policy inferences are dangerously contaminated by endogeneity and selection problems. A high rate of compliance is often the result of states formulating treaties that require them to do little more than they would do in the absence of a treaty. In those cases where noncompliance does occur and where the effects of selection are attenuated, both self-interest and enforcement play significant roles.},

Much theorizing about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role in creating political change, but change processes have been less well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage “life cycle” of emergence, “norm cascades,” and internalization, and that each stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress will only be made by placing attention on the connections between norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

Second, the diffusion literature privileges structure, while the transfer literature privileges agency, but we need an approach which recognizes the dialectical relationship between the two. Third, the diffusion literature concentrates on pattern-finding, while the transfer literature examines process-tracing, but any full explanation of transfer/diffusion needs to do both. Fourth, both literatures suffer from skewed case selection with, in particular, too little attention paid to developing countries. Finally, while both literatures need to be interested in whether diffusion/transfer is likely to be successful/unsuccessful, neither considers any criteria that might be used to establish policy success and failure.},

	abstract = {Why do some international norms succeed, whereas others fail? We argue that norm campaigns are more likely to succeed when the actions they prescribe are framed as a solution to salient problems that potential adopters face, even if different from the problem that originally motivated norm entrepreneurs. For instance, the campaign to reduce environmentally harmful fossil fuel subsidies has been more effective when linked to ﬁscal stability, a common problem that policy makers face. Problem linkages can thus bolster the attractiveness of a proposed new norm and broaden the coalition of actors that support the norm. We probe the plausibility of this argument by studying two campaigns that aim to shift patterns of ﬁnance for fossil fuel production and consumption: subsidy reform and divestment. Subsidy reform encourages governments to reduce subsidies for products like gasoline; divestment encourages investors to sell or avoid equity stocks from fossil fuel industries. We look at the variation in the impact of these two campaigns over time and argue that they have achieved institutional acceptance and implementation chieﬂy when their advocates have been able to link environmental goals with other goals, usually economic ones.},

This article applies theories of norm evolution to the adaptation negotiations. It proposes that the history of these negotiations can best be understood as a contest between two proposed framings that can be roughly characterized as “adaptation as development” and “adaptation as restitution.” These two framings have some similar and some contradictory implications for policy. The article shows that the major areas of consensus and controversy around adaptation in the {UNFCCC} negotiations map closely to these areas of similarity and contradiction, respectively. Though the “adaptation as restitution” norm is relatively disadvantaged on many measures of norm-fitness suggested by previous authors, it nevertheless appears to help explain the development of adaptation institutions both within and outside the {UNFCCC}. A hybridized norm that can be described roughly as “like development but different” is coming to characterize international adaptation institutions.},

	abstract = {Norm dynamics studies typically accord a special status to norm entrepreneurs, actors who promote new global norms. But conceptually privileging these agents of change has meant the norm dynamics literature has become unbalanced and marred by case selection bias. Accordingly, an oppositional role – the ‘norm antipreneur’ – should be recognised to correct these problems. When the normative status quo in an issue-area is entrenched, a clear distinction can be drawn between the entrepreneurs and antipreneurs, because in these contexts the antipreneurs enjoy significant but under-appreciated tactical and strategic advantages. Recognising this enables the construction of a norm dynamics role-spectrum – a sort of ‘typology of roles’ – including ‘competitor entrepreneur’ and ‘creative resister’ in addition to the entrepreneur and antipreneur roles which actors might play in particular norm contestation contexts. Understanding these roles promises to improve analyses of the dynamic interactions between actors in particular norm contestation processes, thereby bringing greater overall balance to the norm dynamics literature.1},

Conversely, although recent constructivist work in international relations has examined the security policies of states, typically it is the state that is doing the constructing of interests. I bridge these two literatures by examining the hard case of transnational civil society working through issue networks to teach state interests in security policy. I analyze the campaign by transnational civil society to generate an international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and trace the effects of several techniques through which states can be said to be socialized. Through generating issues, networking, “grafting,” and using a transnational Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof, the campaign has stimulated systemic normative change through two processes: norm adoption through the conversion of persuaded moral entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from social pressures of identity.},

Despite this, we know very little about what happens after states sign and become parties to such accords. This study systematically examines how states implement and comply with international environmental accords. The culmination of a massive theoretically based empirical research project, it shows how and why implementation and compliance vary among countries and treaties and change over time. It also analyzes the factors that affect the extent of compliance and offers prescriptions for strengthening national compliance with international accords. The book focuses on compliance in eight countries (Brazil, Cameroon, China, Hungary, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States) and the European Union and on five major accords: the {UNESCO} Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the International Maritime Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters (1972), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (1973), the International Tropical Timber Agreement (1983), and the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987). This pioneering venture will be a major resource for scholars interested in compliance in general, in international environmental issues, and in international law. {ContributorsLaszlo} Bencze, Erach Bharucha, Piers Blaikie, Stephen Bunker, Abram Chayes, Antonia Handler Chayes, James Clem, Ellen Comisso, Murillo de Aragão, Elizabeth Economy, James V.

While the terminology and focus often vary, all of these studies are concerned with a similar process in which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political setting (past or present) is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting. Given that this is a growing phenomenon, it is something that anyone studying public policy needs to consider. As such, this article is divided into four major sections. The first section briefly considers the extent of, and reasons for, the growth of policy transfer. The second section then outlines a framework for the analysis of transfer. From here a third section presents a continuum for distinguishing between different types of policy transfer. Finally, the last section addresses the relationship between policy transfer and policy “failure.”},

Not surprisingly, some states have adopted stringent policies that are similar to the federal Superfund program, whereas others have developed different approaches. In this article, we develop and test empirically a model of the strength of state hazardouswaste programs, which we depict as a function of both internal determinants and external diffusion. For internal determinant explanations we consider the effects of problem severity, internal political factors, interest group pressure, and socioeconomic and demographic variables. We also include variables representing regional and top-down (national) diffusion. Our results indicate the importance of both internal determinants and external diffusion. Strong state hazardous waste programs are a function of state wealth and the severity of internal hazardous waste problems, as well as external determinants, with regional diffusion as a particularly influential factor.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (hereafter: Basel Convention) was adopted in 1989. It was a reaction to heightened international awareness of the exponential growth of hazardous waste being produced and the risks it presented to human health, property and the environment while being transported around the globe. The Basel Convention primarily aims to minimise the generation and transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and to keep risks at a tolerable level. It was also a response to the practice of exporting increasing amounts of hazardous waste from the Global North to the Global South. Hence, the Convention is supposed to address concerns regarding environmental justice which arise when industrialised countries profit by exploiting the precarious economic positions of nations in the Global South. Economically challenged countries may accordingly be under pressure to prioritise economic development over environmental concerns when they are offered foreign payments in exchange for accepting toxic waste shipments. By dealing with the disproportionately large share of the burden regarding hazardous waste developing nations face, the Basel Convention has been touted as one of the international agreements at the forefront of integrating environmental justice principles into global trade.},

	abstract = {The Theory of Waste Management represents a more in-depth account of the domain and contains conceptual analyses of waste, the activity upon waste, and a holistic view of the goals of waste management. Waste Management Theory is founded on the expectation that waste management is to prevent waste causing harm to human health and the environment. The proper definition of waste is crucial to constructing a sustainable agenda of waste management. It is largely the case that current legislation attends to existing waste. Definitions emerging from this condition may, however, conflict with the goals of waste prevention, because something that already exists cannot be prevented from arising. When material is assigned the label of ‘waste’, it will be treated as such; consequently, despite its explicit wish of waste prevention, implicitly, legislation essentially amasses waste. The inherent philosophical implication of such definitions is that they are not able to facilitate a sustainable waste management system. Therefore, new, dynamic definitions for waste and waste management must be sought, which can explain why waste is created and can offer an intrinsic solution for the problem. A radically new approach, based on an object-oriented modelling language, is presented to define the key concepts of waste management.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to construct a new agenda for waste management, this paper explores the complex relationship between deﬁnitions of waste and their subsequent impact on its ownership and management. A range of internationally accepted deﬁnitions for waste are analysed and it is concluded that they are inadequate in scope in an attempt to describe waste. The philosophical ramiﬁcations inherent in such deﬁnitions mean that they are not capable of constructing a system that by its very nature results in a sustainable waste management system. This paper explores the concept of waste and a new waste taxonomy is proposed, based on the reason for waste creation, this has profound implications for ownership which in itself often dictates which waste management options are preferentially adopted by a given community. The role of legislation in producing monitoring systems for the transfer of ownership as well as abandonment of ownership is analysed. The new agenda for waste management focuses upon the development of more appropriate, sustainable deﬁnitions so that what is now commonly perceived as being waste will in fact be increasingly seen as resource-rich, ‘non-waste’. To avoid obstacles to resource conservation due to materials being considered waste, a deﬁnition for non-waste is introduced. Finally, a new deﬁnition for waste management is proposed, one that has profound implications for the introduction of a more sustainable waste practice.},

This paper explores three alternative environmental concepts used in transdisciplinary research, and outlines some of the epistemological and practical problems that each one poses. It pays particular attention to the increasingly popular concept of “circular economy”, and contrasts it with the more commonly-used concepts of “environmental sciences” and “sustainable development”. In clarifying the nature, meaning and inter-relationship of these alternative concepts, the paper helps trans-disciplinary researchers to understand the opportunities and challenges associated with each one.},
